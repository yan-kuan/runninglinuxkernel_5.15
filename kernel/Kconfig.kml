        bool "Kernel Mode Linux"

        help
          This enables Kernel Mode Linux. In Kernel Mode Linux, user programs
          can be executed safely in kernel mode and access a kernel address space
          directly. Thus, for example, costly mode switching between a user and a kernel
          can be eliminated. If you say Y here, the kernel enables Kernel Mode Linux.

          More information about Kernel Mode Linux can be found in the
          <file:Documentation/kml.txt>

          If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config KML_CHECK_CHROOT
        bool "Check for chroot"
        default y
        depends on KERNEL_MODE_LINUX
        help
          This enables the check for the current root file system being chrooted
          when executing user processes in kernel mode. In the current KML
          implementation, programs in the dicretory "/trusted" are executed in
          kernel mode. Therefore, the chroot check is necessary because,
          if the root file system is chrooted to "/home/foo/",
          programs in the directory "/home/foo/trusted" are accidentally executed in kernel mode.

          If you don't know what to do here, say Y.
